We built this water-wheel with my daugther Ã‰lise for the miniature
pond in our garden. The fountain is powerered by a solar panel (Kit
Palermo-S d'Esotec).

She did the first hand drawing and built a cardboard prototype. We
then designed the svg model together in two steps, using inkscape.
The current version is laser cut in 3mm thick heavy cardboard. I was
expecting it to tear appart quickly, but it's been holding on for two
months now.

Tip: for the pieces to hold tight, we used 2.8mm wide cuts for 3mm
cardboard. Your milleage may vary depending on the hardness of the
material. The model is designed to adjust easily this parameter: all
cuts are drawn using clones of a single rectangle.
